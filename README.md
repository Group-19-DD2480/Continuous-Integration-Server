# Continuous Integration Server
This is a lightweight Continuous Integration (CI) server built using Flask. It listens for GitHub webhook events, clones repositories on push events, runs build and test processes, and updates the commit status on GitHub accordingly.

At the moment we are in the “Collaborating” state since we have not met all of the requirements listed in the “Performing” state. The following is an overview of our updated checklist for the “Performing” state:

- [x] The team consistently meets its commitments.
- [x] The team continuously adapts to the changing context
- [x] The team identifies and addresses problems without outside help.
- [x] Effective progress is being achieved with minimal avoidable backtracking and reworking.
- [ ] Wasted work and the potential for wasted work are continuously identified and eliminated.
  - At the moment the team does not explicitly and continuously identify wasted work. Instead wasted work is identified in hindsight.

One obstacle to reach the next state is for the team to try to actively and explicitly identify wasted work. To overcome this obstacle the team should establish a framework which describes what wasted work is. Furthermore the team members should also more clearly discuss their current work status in order to prevent two or more people working on the same thing.
